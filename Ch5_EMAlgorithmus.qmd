# The Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm


The EM algorithm is often used to simplify, or make possible, complex maximum likelihood estimation problems. In this chapter, we present the EM algorithm for estimating Gaussian mixture distributions, as this is probably its most well-known application. Even the original work on the EM algorithm [@Dempster_1977] already dealt with the estimation of Gaussian mixture distributions.


**Possible Applications of Gaussian mixture distributions:**

* General: Finding grouping structures (two or more) in data (**Clusteranalyse**). For instance:

  * Automatic video editing (e.g., separation of back- and foreground)  
  * Behavioral clustering 
  * etc.
